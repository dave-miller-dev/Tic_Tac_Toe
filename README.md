# Tic_Tac_Toe
A classic game, also known as naughts and crosses.

How to play:
Each player takes turns entering the coordinates for their next move, hit enter, and if it's a valid move the field will be updated with the players move. X's start, followed by O's.
First player to get three (x3) of the same character in a row wins the game.
If all cells are played, and no player has three in a row, the game is concluded as a draw.


Rules set:
If the player enters coordinates for a cell already played, an error message is displayed, and you are asked to re-enter new coordinates.
If the player enters coordinates out of range, an error message is displayed, and you are asked to re-enter new coordinates.
If the player enters characters that don't comply with the matrix, an error message is displayed, and you are asked to re-enter new coordinates.


About me:
I programmed this game whilst Im learning to code for the first time. Currently learning Python during COVID19 lockdown.
This was part of the course material for JetBrains/Hyperskill Academy.

Thanks for playing.
